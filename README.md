# Python Programmering

### What this repo is all about

This repo is meant for me to complete coding exercises, labs etc for my studies in **python programming** at __ITHS__.

### Making a mark with markdown

I am also using *this README* to experiment with and learn _markdown_ as you can probably tell from my exciting use of _italics_ and **bold**. Let's get crazy and use ***bold and italics at the same time!***

### Blockquotes and you

> This is a blockquote.
>
>By adding a ">" between the two blockquote lines the block does not break.
>
>> We can even nest a blockquote inside another. It's a **crazy** world we live in.

> We can also do some *fancy* things inside a blockquote, such as:
>
> - making a bullet point
> - doing it again, but this time with *italics*
> - making yet another bullet point, which is very **bold**

### Lists - they're good for you

"*And why is that?*", you might ask. 

**Here** are a few reasons:

1. It allows you to list things
2. It does the above.
3. It allows you to repeat the first point if you are out of things to write.
4. All of the above, and:
    1. You can even nest a list inside another list. 
    2. It's true, you're looking at it. 

We can also make the cooler, more chaotic *unordered list*:

- This is one list item.
- This is another.
- This is a third.
- This is *not* the fifth list item.
- **This** is, but no items is truly ordered so this could be a lie.

- **42**\. A fantastic number that I now use to demonstrate that we need to use a *backslash* before a period if we need to start an unordered list with a number followed by a period.
